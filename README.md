Introduction: I am Eman Nasir and I'm from Islamabad. I've done my BSc from COMSATS University ISB in Bioinformatics. I've opted for the same program in masters level as well. 

Interests: I like to read and sometimes like to write as well. I love nature, therefore, i like to capture every moment that mesmerizes me. In short, reading and photography are my interests.

Learning: About this course, the highlited part is using GitHub, which has been tricky so far but an amazing skillset to develop. We have learned basics when it comes to programming so far.
